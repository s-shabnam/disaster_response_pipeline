# disaster_response_pipeline
This project tries to analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.  
The data set contains real messages that were sent during disaster events. 
The machine learning pipeline categorizes these events so that one can send the messages to an appropriate disaster relief agency.  
The project includes a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. 
The web app also displays visualizations of the data.
